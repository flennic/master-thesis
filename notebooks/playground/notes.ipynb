    "**Single-particle trajectories** measured in microscopy experiments contain **important information about dynamic processes undergoing in a range of materials including living cells and tissues**. However, extracting that information is not a trivial task due to the **stochastic nature of particles’ movement and the sampling noise**. In this paper, we adopt a deep-learning method known as a convolutional neural network (CNN) **to classify modes of diffusion from given trajectories**. We compare this fully automated approach working with raw data to classical machine learning techniques that require data preprocessing and extraction of human-engineered features from the trajectories to feed classifiers like random forest or gradient boosting. **All methods are tested using simulated trajectories for which the underlying physical model is known.** From the results it follows that CNN is usually slightly better than the feature-based methods, but at the costs of much longer processing times. Moreover, there are still some borderline cases, in which the classical methods perform better than CNN."
